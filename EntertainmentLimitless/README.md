#  Entertainment Limitless

We have a bug that decreases the user experience but does not limit the functionality of the app overall.
You should be aware that in the GenresView you have to click one of the genres in the Movie list first and then choose a different genre to work correctly.
The same bug happens with the Series list in GenresView.

We were able to implement all of the features proposed except for one to get similar movies, not because we did not have time or because we did not knew how to implement it.
In fact we found an endpoint to do that, but we thought the app is already complete without it and it would have been an overkill.
